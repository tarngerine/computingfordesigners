        Hi techno-curious friend! If you are here you are interested in a
        hypothetical course/workshop taught by me, Julius Tarng, about how to
        make computers do/handle the cool design ideas you have.
      </p>
      
      <aside>
        I'm an "independent software creative" â€” former product designer but now help startups prototype new interface concepts. I've taught many courses on prototyping (e.g. Framer, Origami) but they always felt too tool-specific, too much time debugging and not enough time exploring the cooler abstract ideas.

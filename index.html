        Hi techno-curious friend! If you are here you are interested in a
        hypothetical course/workshop taught by me, Julius Tarng, about how to
        make computers do/handle the cool design ideas you have.
      </p>

          I'm an "independent software creative" ‚Äî former product designer but
          now help startups prototype new interface concepts. I've taught many
          courses on prototyping (e.g. Framer, Origami) but they always felt too
          tool-specific, too much time debugging and not enough time exploring
          the cooler abstract ideas.

        This course is for you if you answer "yes" to one or more of these:
        <br /><br />
        ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Have you ever designed some cool interaction but someone told you it
        wasn't feasible to build it?
        <br /><br />
        üò∞ Do you want to understand how software is made but are intimidated by
        programming?
        <br /><br />
        üò¥ Have you ever taken an intro to programming course but felt it was
        way too low-level/boring compared to what you actually want to do with
        code?
      </p>

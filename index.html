        Hi techno-curious friend! If you are here you are interested in a
        hypothetical course/workshop taught by me, Julius Tarng, about how to
        make computers do/handle the cool design ideas you have.
      </p>

          I'm an "independent software creative" ‚Äî <a href="https://twitter.com/tarngerine">@tarngerine on Twitter</a> ‚Äî former product designer but
          now help startups prototype new interface concepts. I've worked on tools like Webflow, <a href="https://origami.design"></a>Origami, and <a href="https://sprout.place">Sprout</a>. I've taught many
          courses on prototyping (e.g. Framer, Origami) but they always felt too
          tool-specific, too much time debugging and not enough time exploring
          the cooler abstract ideas.

      <p>
        This course is for you if you answer "yes" to one or more of these:
        <br /><br />
        ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Have you ever designed some cool interaction but someone told you it
        wasn't feasible to build it?
        <br /><br />
        üò∞ Do you want to understand how software is made but are intimidated by
        programming?
        <br /><br />
        üò¥ Have you ever taken an intro to programming course but felt it was
        way too low-level/boring compared to what you actually want to do with
        code?
        <br /><br />

      />
        When I say "computing concepts" <i>I mean just that</i>. It's not a euphemism
        for yet another intro-to-javascript class (although we will use some
        javascript because it's very useful).
      </p>

      <p>
        Each participant will submit a cool interaction they've designed or seen
        at the time of registration. Then, each class, we'll take one of those
        and break it down into abstract components that a computer actually
        needs to make it a reality:
        <br /><br />
        üî¢ How does a real-world swipe get translated into something the computer
        understands?
        <br /><br />
        üß† How does the computer remember an interaction's state so that the
        gesture can be interrupted?
        <br /><br />
        üëÅ What are the different ways we could render special effects depending
        on the environment we're in?
        <br /><br />
        We'll write some pseudo-code (the wireframe equivalent for programming)
        and draw tons of diagrams together.
        <br /><br />

        It's an experiment ‚Äî we'll probably do a short run (maybe 4 sessions, 2
        hours each, over 2 months?) with a small group, and record them to
        share. <b>The dialogue between us will be the best part. I'll ask a ton of
        questions but also expect you to ask a ton back.</b> If I don't know
        something, we'll do it live and figure it out. There will be a Discord!

        Success to me looks like: a small community of designers who have deeper
        technical understanding of their craft. I hope you'll come and join me.

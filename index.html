        Hi techno-curious friend! If you are here you are interested in a
        workshop taught by me, Julius Tarng, to help you build a better
        technical intuition.
      </p>
      <p>
        De/reconstruction Interactions is the first beta workshop of the
        Computing for Designers community, and I'm looking for a few beta
        testers for the first run.
      </p>
      <p>
        My vision for Computing for Designers: We‚Äôll explore ideas in computing,
        what the core mental models are that caused software programming and
        design tools to be the way that they are. We‚Äôll look at that through the
        lens of a designer, starting with graphic design (color, type, layout),
        as well as interaction and game design. We‚Äôll talk about markup and
        programming languages (maybe even write our own), data structures,
        software architecture, APIs, shaders‚Ä¶
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a retreat for folks who once were inspired by technology but
        through day to day labor have become jaded about their medium of craft.
        Let‚Äôs take some time to approach things from a technological perspective
        and build a new intuition about this digital material we work with.
      </p>

          <a href="https://twitter.com/tarngerine">@tarngerine on Twitter</a> ‚Äî
          former product designer but now help startups prototype new interface
          concepts. I've led design and engineering teams for creative tools
          like <a href="https://webflow.com">Webflow</a>,
          <a href="https://origami.design">Origami</a>, and
          <a href="https://sprout.place">Sprout</a>. I've taught many courses on
          prototyping but they always felt too tool-specific, with too much time
          debugging and not enough time exploring the cooler abstract ideas.

        This course is for you if you answer "yes" to one or more of these:
        <br /><br />
        ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Have you ever designed some cool idea for an interaction but someone
        told you it wasn't feasible to build it?
        <br /><br />
        üò∞ Do you want to understand how software is made but are intimidated by
        programming?
        <br /><br />
        üßê Are you curious about general computing concepts but haven't found a
        venue to ask questions about it?
        <br /><br />

        When I say "computing concepts" <i>I mean just that</i>. It's not a
        euphemism for yet another intro-to-javascript class.

      <p>
        We'll focus this first workshop on microinteractions. We'll break them
        down into abstract components that a computer actually needs to make it
        a reality:
        <br /><br />
        üî¢ How does a real-world swipe get translated into something the
        computer understands?
        <br /><br />
        üß† How does the computer remember an interaction's state so that the
        gesture can be interrupted?
        <br /><br />
        üëÅ What are the different ways different computers use to render the
        interface or graphics to screen?
        <br /><br />
        We'll create our own pseudo-code (the wireframe equivalent for
        programming), and draw tons of diagrams together, and discuss related
        topics like data structures and APIs. We'll co-create a digital zine to
        explore the concepts we discussed together.
        <br /><br />

        It's an experiment ‚Äî we'll probably do a short run (maybe 3 sessions, 2
        hours each) with a small group, and record them to share.

          >The dialogue between us will be the best part. I'll ask a ton of
          questions but also expect you to ask a ton back.</b
        >
        If I don't know something, we'll do it live and figure it out. There
        will be a Discord!

        Success to me looks like: a small community of designers who have deeper
        technical understanding of their craft. I hope you'll come and join me.
